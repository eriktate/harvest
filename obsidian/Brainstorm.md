# Harvest
## Concept
A post-apocalyptic fantasy world where the only land left to support crops is fraught with danger and crawling with monsters. Only the best, bravest, and strongest are chosen to be farmers, tasked with growing as much food as possible while fighting off droves of monsters and fiends.

## Aesthetic
Dark, moody colors (Below, Darkest Dungeon, Isaac). Maybe post-apocalyptic medieval/fantasy? Goal of the game is to produce as much food as possible each day. You get a report from the city you support each day letting you know how many people died of starvation (think Papers Please).

## Game mechanics
- Top down perspective (undecided on full character rotation or "bilboards" like don't starve)
- Lots of systems
	- Tilling
	- Planting
	- Watering
	- Harvesting
	- Feeding animals
	- Building defenses
	- Levling/skilling up
	- Hiring NPC workers
	- Shop
- Rouge-lite elements like perma death and "run" based gameplay. All items and _most_ upgrades lost on each death. Need to figure out which upgrades sustain between deaths
- Defenses are custom built by players and include things like walls, manned turrets, magic turrets, traps, etc. Players will have to manage balancing having enough space to grow food and not spreading themselves too thin to defend
- Day/night cycle where day time is mostly safe and can be used for building your defenses and farming. Night time is when the majority of creatures spawn and attack your farm. The more successful your farm is, and the longer you survive, the more dangerous each night becomes.
- A shopkeeper visits every daywith a donkey pulling a carriage and offers you supplies and contracts in exchange for food. The shopkeeper also delivers your daily haul to the city.
- Each morning, after surviving the night, a carrier pigeon delivers a report of the happenings in the city. I'm taking a lot of inspiration from Paper's Please here. This is where much of the story will be developed and players can get a sense for what this world is like and the people they're fighting for
- Initially, the monsters are pretty primitive and attack randomly. This poses the least amount of threat to your walls unless large groups happen to assemble in one place. Over time, the monsters will become more advanced and start to focus points in your defenses to break through
- Demolishing structures should be possible (with some amount of resource return)
